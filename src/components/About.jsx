      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I’m <strong>Shubham Atri </strong> ,
I’m a frontend developer and engineering student from Himachal Pradesh, passionate about building clean and responsive web experiences using React, JavaScript, and modern tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with web development, I’m actively involved in the Robotics Society at NIT Hamirpur, where I work on IoT, automation, and tech-focused workshops. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills and curiosity across both software and hardware.
      </p>
      <p>I love learning, exploring new technologies, and improving myself—whether it’s communication, coding, or understanding how things work. Outside tech, I enjoy traveling across Himachal and discovering new places.</p>
   <p>My goal is simple: to learn, build, and create meaningful projects.</p>
